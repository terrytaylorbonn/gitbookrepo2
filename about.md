# About

This is the Mythical Game Services API Reference.\
\
The endpoints are organized into 8 sections in the order that you would normally use them to build up a new game environment:\


* 1\. Item classes. An item class is required for an item.
* 2\. Items. An item is used to create player items.
* 3\. Item tokens. An item token defines the ERC-721 contract on the blockchain.
* 4\. Item token metadata. Metadata conforms to the OpenSea format.
* 5\. Players. A player can be a Mythical player (verified email) or a studio player (anonymous, created when a player first plays a game).
* 5b. Account linking
* 6\. Player custom data.
* 7\. Player items. Created when items are granted to a player.
* 7e. Player currency.
* 8\. Player items custom data.

Each endpoint has an example request/response. You can build your own basic game environment by doing the example for the first endpoint in each of the 8 sections.\
